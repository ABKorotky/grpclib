Changelog

Unreleased
~~~~~~~~~~

  - Implemented Health service with additional functionality to help write
    health checks
  - Implemented ``channel_for`` helper for writing functional tests
  - Added support for UNIX sockets; pull request courtesy Andy Kipp
  - Implemented server reflection protocol
  - **BREAKING:** Fixed metadata encoding. Previously grpclib were using
    utf-8 to encode metadata, and now grpclib encodes metadata according to the
    gRPC wire protocol specification: ascii for regular values and base64 for
    binary values
  - **BREAKING:** Fixed "grpc-message" header encoding: unicode string -> utf-8
    -> percent-encoding (RFC 3986, ascii subset). Previously solely utf-8 were
    used, which now will fail to decode, if you send non-ascii characters
  - Implemented sending custom metadata from the server-side
